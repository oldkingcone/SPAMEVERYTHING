The following options are available to you when you use this tool. They are:

- Telegram (this will help spam a telegram webhook, which has become more commonly used in stealer malware.)
- Grabify (in the event someone is trying to ip log you, however, grabify blocks TOR, and most proxies.)
- Discord (this will send a lot of requests to a webhook endpoint for the discord platform, use with caution.)
